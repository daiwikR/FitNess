# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Tracker App (Java + Swing GUI)

A desktop-based Fitness Tracker application developed in Java using **Swing GUI framework** and structured around the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern. This application serves as a complete fitness companion allowing users to track workouts, log meals, calculate BMI, manage reminders, and visualize progress — all within a responsive user interface.
